Solution Structure
Abstract Base Class (Entity):

An abstract base class that defines common attributes (id, name, description).
Contains abstract methods that each subclass must implement.
Specialized Subclasses:

Four subclasses (Book, Movie, Gadget, and Vehicle) represent different types of entities with their unique properties and methods.
Each subclass:
Implements specific behavior, including unique attributes and methods.
Overrides common methods where necessary to reflect specific behavior.
Polymorphic Processing:

A method accepts Entity objects in a unified way, demonstrating polymorphism.
The method processes each entity in a polymorphic manner, enabling dynamic behavior based on the entity type.
Additional Complexity:

Each subclass includes additional complexity, such as:
Gadget checks warranty status based on purchase date.
Vehicle calculates fuel range.
Book checks for overdue status based on loan duration.
Movie recommends similar movies based on genre and rating.
